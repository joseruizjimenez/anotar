Anotar is a taking note app

We want:
    - A fast web app
    - Liquid templates to show a simple and beautiful interface on any device
    - Zero learning curve

To do:
    - Add AJAX index showing new notes
    - Add 'public notes' with route: /notes/:id (show verb checking: if not his note: has it 'shared'?)
    - Add Javascript note style in client, not in server

Have fun :)
