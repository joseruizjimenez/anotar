Anotar is a taking note app

We want:
    - A fast web app
    - Liquid templates to show a simple and beautiful interface on any device (Bootstrap)
    - Zero learning curve

To do:
    - Add AJAX index showing new notes
    - Add complex search logic
    - Add Javascript note's text styling in client, not in server

Have fun :)
